- What is class based views and its advangages?
>>> Class-based views provide an alternative way to implement views as Python objects instead of functions. They do not replace function-based views, but have certain differences and advantages when compared to function-based views:

-- Object oriented techniques such as mixins (multiple inheritance) can be used to factor code into reusable components.
